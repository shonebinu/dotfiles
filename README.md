# dotfiles
My personal dotfiles managed using GNU Stow

Clone the repo and enter the repo's root directory, then run `stow <foldername>` to restore the appropriate configuration of the same program.

Please replace `<foldername>` with the actual name of the folder you want to use with the stow command.

Currently I use Sway window manager with two monitors (one horizontal + one vertical), here's a quick look.

I'm using Neovim [NvChad](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad) config here, although I'm satisfied with this setup, I'm really interested in the flexibility that Emacs offer, so I'm learning it in the side.
